and
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate new images on the APTOS dataset.

## Dataset
The APTOS dataset consists of retinal images for diabetic retinopathy classification. You can download the dataset from APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection.
Ensure that the dataset is placed in the correct directory as specified in the notebook.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on the DDPM framework, which utilizes a diffusion process to generate high-quality images. Key components of the architecture include:
#### SinusoidalPositionEmbeddings
This class generates sinusoidal embeddings for time steps, which are crucial for encoding temporal information into the model. It uses sine and cosine functions to create embeddings that help the model understand the timing of the diffusion process.
#### AttentionBlock
The AttentionBlock class implements multi-head self-attention using PyTorch's MultiheadAttention. It allows the model to focus on different parts of the input feature map, enhancing its ability to capture complex dependencies in the data.
#### ResnetBlock
The ResnetBlock class defines a residual block that includes convolutional layers, normalization, and optional attention mechanisms. This structure helps in training deeper networks by allowing gradients to flow through the network more easily.
#### DownSample and UpSample
These classes are responsible for downsampling and upsampling feature maps, respectively. They help in reducing the spatial dimensions of the input during encoding and restoring them during decoding, which is essential for the UNet architecture.
#### UNet
The UNet class is the main architecture used in this model. It combines the encoder and decoder parts, utilizing skip connections to retain spatial information. The model is designed to learn how to denoise images effectively by leveraging the hierarchical features extracted at different resolutions.

## Training
Training Process
#### Objective: 
The primary goal during training is to learn the model parameters that minimize the loss function. This involves adjusting the weights of the neural network based on the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual targets.
#### Data Handling: 
During training, the model is exposed to a large number of training samples. Data augmentation techniques may also be applied to enhance the diversity of the training set.
#### Loss Calculation: 
A loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) is computed after each forward pass through the network. This loss quantifies how well the model's predictions match the actual data.
#### Backpropagation: 
After calculating the loss, backpropagation is used to update the model weights. This involves computing gradients and adjusting the weights in the direction that reduces the loss.
#### Iterations: 
The training process is iterative and typically involves multiple epochs, where the model passes through the entire training dataset multiple times.
Performance Monitoring: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are monitored during training to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

## Inference
Inference Process
#### Objective: 
The goal during inference is to generate predictions or classifications based on new, unseen data. The model uses the parameters learned during training to make these predictions.
#### Data Handling: 
Inference typically involves a single input or a batch of inputs that the model has not seen before. There is no data augmentation applied during this phase.
#### No Loss Calculation: 
Unlike training, there is no loss function computed during inference. The model simply outputs predictions based on the input data.
#### No Backpropagation: 
The inference process does not involve updating the model weights. The trained model is used as-is to generate outputs.
#### Single Pass: 
Inference usually requires only a single forward pass through the network for each input, making it significantly faster than training.
#### Output Interpretation: 
The outputs generated during inference are interpreted directly as predictions, such as class labels or generated images, depending on the task.
